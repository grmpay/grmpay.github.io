               <font color=#5788d6>Who recommends Tithe.ly?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> After a thorough search of digital giving platforms, our Stewardship Committee recommended Tithe.ly, which was endorsed by our Finance Committee, and blessed by the Church Council. Tithe.ly has also been endorsed by the ELCA as a preferred vendor for digital giving. </font> <br><br>

                <font color=#5788d6>Is my Credit/Debit card information secure?</font> <br>
               <font color="white">     Yes! Tithe.ly takes data and payment information security very seriously. All sensitive financial information is stored with bank level security. All information transmission to Tithe.ly’s banking partner and on our site is done via an encrypted HTTPS (SSL) connection, and stored by the banking partner to PCI DSS Level 1 compliant standards. </font> <br><br>

                <font color=#5788d6>How will my data be used?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> Your personal data will never be sold, traded, or given out to third parties. Your information will be stored only for the purposes of processing your gifts and providing you with giving statements. <a href="https://get.tithe.ly/privacy-policy"  target="_blank"> Read the Tithe.ly privacy policy.</a> </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>How will I know when my credit, debit, or ACH is charged?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> Anytime you are charged you will receive an email notification from Tithe.ly. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>Can I give to different funds?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> Yes. On the second line of the Giving form, under the label “Give to” you may select to direct your donation to either the General Fund, or one of our other funds. If you would like to give to more than one fund, click the “  Add Gift” button on the next line to add another gift to your transaction. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>Will I get a receipt?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> Absolutely! As soon as you give via Tithe.ly you will instantly receive an email with the details of your transaction. All of your online giving history is also tracked and available within Tithe.ly interface, giving you instant access to check your records. Click the   <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"> </i> 
 button to access your account details. You will still receive a giving statement from the church as usual with your total giving amounts. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>What if I accidentally type the wrong amount?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> If you make a mistake while entering a gift, contact the <a href="mailto:grmmedia16@gmail.com">Great Redemption Ministries Tech Support Team</a> and we can refund the incorrect amount and set up another donation for the correct amount. Refunds may take up to 7 business days to appear back in your account. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>What Giving methods are available?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> You can give using your VISA, MasterCard, Discover, or AMEX. ACH bank transfer (aka eCheck) donations are also supported by Tithe.ly church giving. Please consider giving by ACH as it incurs a smaller processing fee, ensuring more of your donation goes to supporting our ministry.</font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>How do I change or update my payment method?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> Click the <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"> </i>  button to access your account details. Click “Payment Methods” to add or remove payment methods. Click the buttons at the bottom of the screen to switch between your credit/debit cards and your bank account (ACH) details. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>What is “Cover card processing fees”?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> All electronic giving involves processing fees. These fees help cover the cost of processing each electronic transaction, and maintaining a secure and safe environment for your transactions. By selecting the “Cover card processing fees” option, you increase your donation by the amount of the fee, ensuring St. Peter’s receives your full intended gift amount. To reduce processing fees, consider giving by ACH bank transfer (aka eCheck). </font> <br><br>


               <font color=#5788d6>How do I change my auto recurring giving amount?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> Click the <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"> </i> button to access your account details. Click “Recurring Gifts”. On this screen, you’ll see your existing recurring gifts. Click the red trash icon to delete your existing current gift that you’d like to change. Click the <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"> </i> button and return to the Home page of the app. Then setup a new auto recurring gift for the desired amount. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>Do I have to have a Tithe.ly account to give?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> When giving, registering, or paying via the Tithe.ly web giving form you do NOT have to create a Tithe.ly account to make one-time or recurring donations. Simply enter your payment details and click the Give button. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>What benefits are there to setting up a Tithe.ly account?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> By creating an account, you’ll be able to securely store your payment method (so you don’t have to enter it each time), setup and manage recurring donations, see your online giving history, and manage your account yourself 24/7. </font> <br><br>

               <font color=#5788d6>What about Paypal?</font> <br>
               <font color="white"> As of 08/2017, Great Redemption Ministries has retracted its PayPal account. All transactions and donations are processed through GRMpay using tithe.ly. Please contact the <a href="mailto:grmmedia16@gmail.com">Great Redemption Ministries Tech Support Team </a> if you'd like to learn more about the reasoning behind the transition.</font> <br><br>
